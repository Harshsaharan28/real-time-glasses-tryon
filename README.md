#  Real time glasses try-on

A real-time virtual try-on system for glasses that lets users scroll through a catalog of eyewear and see how each style fits their face using their webcam. It automatically aligns glasses to your eyes and rotates them based on your head tilt for a realistic experience.

🚧 **Recommendation system coming soon!** Glasses will be auto-suggested based on face shape and preferences.
